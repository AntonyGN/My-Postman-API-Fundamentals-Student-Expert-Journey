# First API request 
Using the request ``URL``Â toÂ ``GET`` ```https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books```

## Task: Search books by genre
The API allows us to add query parameters to a ``GET /books`` request to filter the results

## Get all fiction books

Let's filter the library catalog to get all the fiction books. We can recycle the first request since we are hitting the same ``GET /books`` endpoint.

1. In Postman inside the ``Postman Library API v2 Collection`` you made, hover over the ``get books`` request, click the three dots icon that appears, then select Duplicate to create a copy of the request.

2. Rename this second request from the default ``get books Copy`` to ``get fiction books``. You can hover on the collection name in the right pane and click the edit icon that appears.

3. Using the ``Params tab``, add a query parameter with key ``genre`` and value ``fiction`` to the ``get fiction books`` request. Notice how Postman syncs the request URL in real time, adding the question mark ? automatically to mark the start of query parameters!

4. Save your request

5. Send your request

6. You should get a ``200 OK`` response with an array of books objects - but only books with the ``fiction genre!``

  Request ``URL``to Get all fiction books ```https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books?genre=fiction```

# Task: Multiple query parameters

As a librarian you'll need to help visitors find books that are available (not checked out).

Let's add a second query parameter to ``GET /books`` to only return books where the ``checkedOut`` property is false. 

## Add another query parameter
1. In the same ``get fiction books`` request, in the ``Params`` tab add a second query parameter with ```key checkedOut``` and value ``false``

2. Save your request 

3. Send your request

You should get a ``200 OK`` response with an array of only fiction books that are not checked out, or an empty array [] if there are no fiction books available.

  Request ``URL``to multiple query parameters ```https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books?genre=fiction&checkedOut=false```

  JSON response

    },
```

# Path Parameters

Another way of passing request data to an API is via path parameters. A path parameter (or "path variable") is a dynamic section of a path, and is often used for IDs and entity names such as usernames. 

## Path parameter syntax

Path parameters come immediately after a slash in the path. For example, the GitHub API allows you to search for GitHub users by providing a username in the path in place of ``{username}`` below:

```GET https://api.github.com/users/{username}```

Making this API call with a value for ``{username}`` will fetch data about that user:

```GET https://api.github.com/users/postmanlabs```

You can have multiple path parameters in a single request, such as this endpoint for getting a user's GitHub code repository:

```GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repoName}```

For example, to get information about the newman code repository from postmanlabs:

```GET https://api.github.com/repos/postmanlabs/newman```

# Task: Get a book by id

Someone keeps coming into the library every day asking whether ``Ficciones`` by Jorge Luis Borges is available. 

When you fetched all the books in the library, you may have noticed that each book as a unique ``id`` value. This ``id`` can always be used to identify the book, even if its other properties are changed.

Since this person keeps asking about ``Ficciones``, you've jotted down that the unique ``id`` for this book is ``29cd820f-82f9-4b45-a7f4-0924111b5b89``

(Don't believe me? You can always search for ``Ficciones`` with the search query parameter: ``GET /books?search=ficciones``)

## Get a book by id

According to the API documentation, we can get a specific book by hitting the path ``GET /books/:id``, where we replace ``:id`` with the book's ``id``.

1. Hover on your Postman Library API v2 Collection, click the three dots icon and select ``Add request``. Name your new request ``get book by id``

2. Make sure the request method is set to ``GET``, and paste in this endpoint as the request URL: ```https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books/:id```

   Postman automatically adds a ``Path Variables`` editor in the ``Params`` tab of the request for any path parameters in the request URL prefixed with a colon :

3. In the ``Params`` tab of the request, paste the ``id`` for ``Ficciones`` (``29cd820f-82f9-4b45-a7f4-0924111b5b89``) as the ``value`` for the parameter named ``id``. *Make sure not to add any whitespace around the id value*.

4. Save your request

5. Send your request

You should get a ``200 OK`` response with a single JSON object that represents the ``Ficciones`` book. At the time of this example, the book is not checked out:

``JSON` response

```
{
    "id": "29cd820f-82f9-4b45-a7f4-0924111b5b89",
    "title": "Ficciones",
    "author": "Jorge Luis Borges",
    "genre": "fiction",
    "yearPublished": 1944,
    "checkedOut": false,
    "isPermanentCollection": true,
    "createdAt": "2022-03-30T00:54:52.606Z"
}
```

# Debugging requests in the Postman Console
You used Postman's path variable helper in the **Params** tab of the request to add a path variable nicknamed ``:id`` to the request URL in a human-friendly way. Postman replaces ``:id`` with the value you specify for ``id`` in the Path Variables editor.

You can always view the raw request sent to the API by opening the **Postman Console** in the lower left of Postman.

All requests you make and their responses are logged in the Postman Console. Scroll to the bottom to expand the most recent request. 

You can see that Postman has inserted the book ``id`` as a path parameter in place of the ``:id`` placeholder when making the request. Cool!

If you run into any errors when making API calls, always check the Postman Console and make sure the raw request was sent as you expected.*A common error is adding accidental white space in your query or path parameter values.*

# Sending data with POST

## Task: Add a book

Someone wants to donate a book to the library! 

In this task we will learn how to add a **Body** to a **POST** request in order to submit data to an API.

## Make a POST request
1.  Hover over your **Postman Library API v2 Collection**, click the three dots icon and select **Add request**. Name you new request **add a book**

2.  Set the request method to **POST** and the request URL to 
``https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books``

3.  This endpoint requires adding a **body** to our request to send a payload. Our payload will be a JSON object containing the information about the book we are adding.

Click the **Body** tab of the request and select that data type **raw > JSON**

4. Think of a book you love or have read recently.

Inside the Body editor, add a JSON object with details about the new book's **title**, **author**, **genre** and **yearPublished**.

You can copy this object and **replace the values with details about your book!**

```
{
  "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  "author": "Harper Lee",
  "genre": "fiction",
  "yearPublished": 1960
}
```
5.  Save your request

6.   Send your request

   ## ðŸ˜± Uh-oh! 

The response from the server came back with a status ```401 Unauthorized```. Remember that 400-level errors are client errors, meaning we made a mistake in our request. 

### The body of the response has a message explaining we need to add an api-key to the headers of the request. Let's take care of that next!



# Task: Add an authorization header

Some APIs require **Authorization** (aka **Auth**) for certain endpoint in order to permit a request.

## Authorization

Think about why you might not want an API to have completely open endpoints that anyone can access publicly. It would allow unauthorized people to access data they shouldn't see, or allow bots to flood an API with thousands of calls per second and shut it down. 

There are multiple methods for authorizing a request. Some examples are **Basic Auth** (username and password), **OAuth** (password-less authorization), and **API Keys** (secret strings registered to a developer from an API).

# Getting an API Key

APIs that use API Key auth usually allow developers to sign up in a developer portal, where they will receive a random API Key that can be used to authorize their requests to the API. The API Key allows the API to track who is making calls and how often.  

The Postman Library API v2 uses very light protection and does not require you to register for an API Key. You simply have to know it:

Header name: ``api-key``
Header value: ``postmanrulz``

As the documentation shows, the Postman Library API v2 requires adding this **header** to any requests for adding, updating and deleting books, since these operations actually change data in the database as opposed to simply reading them.

## Headers

Headers are how we can add **metadata** about our requests, such as authorization information or specify the data type we want to receive in a response. This is different than the actual payload data we send in the body of a request, such as our new book information.

You can think of headers like the outside of an envelope when you send a letter. The envelope has information about delivering the letter, like proof that you've paid for postage. The actual data "payload" is the letter inside the envelope.

# Add the API Key to the request header

1. On your "add a book" request, click the Headers tab

2. In the Headers helper table, add the **key** ``api-key`` with a **value** of ``postmanrulz``

3.  Save your request

4.  Send your request

 ## ðŸš€ Success!
Your book was added! Now that your request is properly authorized in the header, you should get a **201 Created** response with a response body that is an object representing your newly added book!

```
{
    "id": "a575715c-2832-4fb9-8599-49cfe5a35b9b",
    "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
    "author": "Harper Lee",
    "genre": "fiction",
    "yearPublished": 1960,
    "checkedOut": false,
    "isPermanentCollection": false,
    "createdAt": "2023-09-18T11:02:14.741Z"
}
```

Your new book has been assigned a random unique ``id``, and has extra information now such as it's ``checkedOut`` status and when it was added to the library (``createdAt``)

##View your new book

You can now return to your ``get books`` request, add the query parameter ``search`` with a value of the title of the book you added.

Anyone can now see your book when they fetch books!
