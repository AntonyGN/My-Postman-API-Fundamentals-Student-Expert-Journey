# First API request 
Using the request ``URL`` to ``GET`` ```https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books```

## Task: Search books by genre
The API allows us to add query parameters to a ``GET /books`` request to filter the results

## Get all fiction books

Let's filter the library catalog to get all the fiction books. We can recycle the first request since we are hitting the same ``GET /books`` endpoint.

1. In Postman inside the ``Postman Library API v2 Collection`` you made, hover over the ``get books`` request, click the three dots icon that appears, then select Duplicate to create a copy of the request.

2. Rename this second request from the default ``get books Copy`` to ``get fiction books``. You can hover on the collection name in the right pane and click the edit icon that appears.

3. Using the ``Params tab``, add a query parameter with key ``genre`` and value ``fiction`` to the ``get fiction books`` request. Notice how Postman syncs the request URL in real time, adding the question mark ? automatically to mark the start of query parameters!

4. Save your request

5. Send your request

6. You should get a ``200 OK`` response with an array of books objects - but only books with the ``fiction genre!``

  Request ``URL``to Get all fiction books ```https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books?genre=fiction```

# Task: Multiple query parameters

As a librarian you'll need to help visitors find books that are available (not checked out).

Let's add a second query parameter to ``GET /books`` to only return books where the ``checkedOut`` property is false. 

## Add another query parameter
1. In the same ``get fiction books`` request, in the ``Params`` tab add a second query parameter with ```key checkedOut``` and value ``false``

2. Save your request 

3. Send your request

You should get a ``200 OK`` response with an array of only fiction books that are not checked out, or an empty array [] if there are no fiction books available.

  Request ``URL``to multiple query parameters ```https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books?genre=fiction&checkedOut=false```

  JSON response 
  ```
{
        "id": "d284914a-4b60-4d9d-b76b-c3ffbe5f6a05",
        "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
        "author": "Harper Lee",
        "genre": "fiction",
        "yearPublished": 1960,
        "checkedOut": false,
        "isPermanentCollection": false,
        "createdAt": "2023-09-18T06:50:46.080Z"
    },
```

# Path Parameters

Another way of passing request data to an API is via path parameters. A path parameter (or "path variable") is a dynamic section of a path, and is often used for IDs and entity names such as usernames. 

## Path parameter syntax

Path parameters come immediately after a slash in the path. For example, the GitHub API allows you to search for GitHub users by providing a username in the path in place of ``{username}`` below:

```GET https://api.github.com/users/{username}```

Making this API call with a value for ``{username}`` will fetch data about that user:

```GET https://api.github.com/users/postmanlabs```

You can have multiple path parameters in a single request, such as this endpoint for getting a user's GitHub code repository:

```GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repoName}```

For example, to get information about the newman code repository from postmanlabs:

```GET https://api.github.com/repos/postmanlabs/newman```

# Task: Get a book by id

Someone keeps coming into the library every day asking whether ``Ficciones`` by Jorge Luis Borges is available. 

When you fetched all the books in the library, you may have noticed that each book as a unique ``id`` value. This ``id`` can always be used to identify the book, even if its other properties are changed.

Since this person keeps asking about ``Ficciones``, you've jotted down that the unique ``id`` for this book is ``29cd820f-82f9-4b45-a7f4-0924111b5b89``

(Don't believe me? You can always search for ``Ficciones`` with the search query parameter: ``GET /books?search=ficciones``)

## Get a book by id

According to the API documentation, we can get a specific book by hitting the path ``GET /books/:id``, where we replace ``:id`` with the book's ``id``.

1. Hover on your Postman Library API v2 Collection, click the three dots icon and select ``Add request``. Name your new request ``get book by id``

2. Make sure the request method is set to ``GET``, and paste in this endpoint as the request URL: ```https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books/:id```

   Postman automatically adds a ``Path Variables`` editor in the ``Params`` tab of the request for any path parameters in the request URL prefixed with a colon :

3. In the ``Params`` tab of the request, paste the ``id`` for ``Ficciones`` (``29cd820f-82f9-4b45-a7f4-0924111b5b89``) as the ``value`` for the parameter named ``id``. *Make sure not to add any whitespace around the id value*.

4. Save your request

5. Send your request

You should get a ``200 OK`` response with a single JSON object that represents the ``Ficciones`` book. At the time of this example, the book is not checked out:

``JSON` response

```
{
    "id": "29cd820f-82f9-4b45-a7f4-0924111b5b89",
    "title": "Ficciones",
    "author": "Jorge Luis Borges",
    "genre": "fiction",
    "yearPublished": 1944,
    "checkedOut": false,
    "isPermanentCollection": true,
    "createdAt": "2022-03-30T00:54:52.606Z"
}
```

# Debugging requests in the Postman Console
You used Postman's path variable helper in the **Params** tab of the request to add a path variable nicknamed ``:id`` to the request URL in a human-friendly way. Postman replaces ``:id`` with the value you specify for ``id`` in the Path Variables editor.

You can always view the raw request sent to the API by opening the **Postman Console** in the lower left of Postman.

All requests you make and their responses are logged in the Postman Console. Scroll to the bottom to expand the most recent request. 

You can see that Postman has inserted the book ``id`` as a path parameter in place of the ``:id`` placeholder when making the request. Cool!

If you run into any errors when making API calls, always check the Postman Console and make sure the raw request was sent as you expected.*A common error is adding accidental white space in your query or path parameter values.*

# Sending data with POST

## Task: Add a book

Someone wants to donate a book to the library! 

In this task we will learn how to add a **Body** to a **POST** request in order to submit data to an API.

## Make a POST request
1.  Hover over your **Postman Library API v2 Collection**, click the three dots icon and select **Add request**. Name you new request **add a book**

2.  Set the request method to **POST** and the request URL to 
``https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books``

3.  This endpoint requires adding a **body** to our request to send a payload. Our payload will be a JSON object containing the information about the book we are adding.

Click the **Body** tab of the request and select that data type **raw > JSON**

4. Think of a book you love or have read recently.

Inside the Body editor, add a JSON object with details about the new book's **title**, **author**, **genre** and **yearPublished**.

You can copy this object and **replace the values with details about your book!**

```
{
  "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
  "author": "Harper Lee",
  "genre": "fiction",
  "yearPublished": 1960
}
```
5.  Save your request

6.   Send your request

   ## 😱 Uh-oh! 

The response from the server came back with a status ```401 Unauthorized```. Remember that 400-level errors are client errors, meaning we made a mistake in our request. 

### The body of the response has a message explaining we need to add an api-key to the headers of the request. Let's take care of that next!



# Task: Add an authorization header

Some APIs require **Authorization** (aka **Auth**) for certain endpoint in order to permit a request.

## Authorization

Think about why you might not want an API to have completely open endpoints that anyone can access publicly. It would allow unauthorized people to access data they shouldn't see, or allow bots to flood an API with thousands of calls per second and shut it down. 

There are multiple methods for authorizing a request. Some examples are **Basic Auth** (username and password), **OAuth** (password-less authorization), and **API Keys** (secret strings registered to a developer from an API).

# Getting an API Key

APIs that use API Key auth usually allow developers to sign up in a developer portal, where they will receive a random API Key that can be used to authorize their requests to the API. The API Key allows the API to track who is making calls and how often.  

The Postman Library API v2 uses very light protection and does not require you to register for an API Key. You simply have to know it:

Header name: ``api-key``
Header value: ``postmanrulz``

As the documentation shows, the Postman Library API v2 requires adding this **header** to any requests for adding, updating and deleting books, since these operations actually change data in the database as opposed to simply reading them.

## Headers

Headers are how we can add **metadata** about our requests, such as authorization information or specify the data type we want to receive in a response. This is different than the actual payload data we send in the body of a request, such as our new book information.

You can think of headers like the outside of an envelope when you send a letter. The envelope has information about delivering the letter, like proof that you've paid for postage. The actual data "payload" is the letter inside the envelope.

# Add the API Key to the request header

1. On your "add a book" request, click the Headers tab

2. In the Headers helper table, add the **key** ``api-key`` with a **value** of ``postmanrulz``

3.  Save your request

4.  Send your request

 ## 🚀 Success!
Your book was added! Now that your request is properly authorized in the header, you should get a **201 Created** response with a response body that is an object representing your newly added book!

```
{
    "id": "a575715c-2832-4fb9-8599-49cfe5a35b9b",
    "title": "To Kill a Mockingbird",
    "author": "Harper Lee",
    "genre": "fiction",
    "yearPublished": 1960,
    "checkedOut": false,
    "isPermanentCollection": false,
    "createdAt": "2023-09-18T11:02:14.741Z"
}
```

Your new book has been assigned a random unique ``id``, and has extra information now such as it's ``checkedOut`` status and when it was added to the library (``createdAt``)

## View your new book

You can now return to your ``get books`` request, add the query parameter ``search`` with a value of the title of the book you added.

Anyone can now see your book when they fetch books!

After confirming, you can **uncheck** the ``search`` **query parameter** to disable it and Save your request.

# Task: Use Postman Auth instead!

Postman has an Auth helper that makes authorizing requests even easier!

## Delete the ``api-key`` header

Before we use the Postman Auth helper, let's remove the hard-coded header we just added on the **add a book** request.

Hover over the ``api-key`` header in the **Headers** tab and click the **delete** icon at the right to **delete the header**. Save your request.

## Add Auth to the Collection

The Postman Auth helper can help you add authorization at the request, folder or collection level.

Let's add the api-key to our entire collection so that all requests will send the key. 

1. Click on your collection **Postman Library API v2** and select the **Authorization** (or **Auth**) tab

2. Select **API Key** as the auth **Type**

3. Enter the API Key details in the fields below. **Key**: ``api-key``, **Value:** ``postmanrulz``, **Add to: Header**

4. Save the changes to your collection by clicking the floppy disk icon in the upper right (important!)

5. Now all requests inside this collection that use the auth method **Inherit from parent** will have this header attached, and therefore be authorized.


## Add a new book

1. Go back to your **add a book** request and **add another book by changing the body in the Body tab**

2. Make sure the Auth method in the **Authorization** tab of your request is set to "Inherit from parent" in order to use the API Key we set at the collection level. This is the default behavior for requests.

3. Save your request and hit Send!

4. Open up the Postman Console in the lower left and you'll see that the API Key has been added as a header ``api-key: postmanrulz``, which is why we were authorized to add a book!

   ```
   POST https://library-api.postmanlabs.com/books
     Network
     Request Headers
       Content-Type: application/json
       api-key: postmanrulz

# Introduction to variables and scripting

## Variables in Postman

Postman allows you to save values as variables so that you can:

1. Reuse values to keep your work DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)

2. Hide sensitive values like API keys from being shared publicly

In this section we will add variables to our collection to introduce better practices and allow us to make dynamic requests. 


## Variable scopes

You can set variables that live at various scopes. Postman will resolve to the value at the nearest and narrowest scope.

In order from broadest to narrowest, these scopes are: **global**, **collection**, **environment**, **data**, and **local**.

We will work with **collection variables** today, which are variables that live at the collection level and be can accessed anywhere inside the collection.


## Variable syntax

Once a variable is defined, you can access its value using double curly brace syntax like this:

``{{variableName}}``

In the next section you will learn how to set a variable.

## Task: Set **baseUrl** variable

One way to set a variable is to highlight the input text you'd like to convert into a variable, and follow the "Set as variable" popup instructions. 

## Make a ``baseUrl`` variable

We use the same base URL for all requests to the library API. We can simplify our requests by replacing ``https://library-api.postmanlabs.com`` with a variable called ``{{baseUrl}}``

1. Go to the first ``get books`` request in your collection.

2. With your cursor, select the entire base URL of the API (``https://library-api.postmanlabs.com``). Do not include the slash ``/`` after ``.com``.

  Click **Set as variable** to save the base URL to a variable.

3. Click Set as a new variable

4. Name your new variable **baseUrl** and select **Collection** as the scope, then click **Set variable**

   Now that the variable is set, you can access the value anywhere in your collection by typing ``{{baseUrl}}``
   
5. Hover over ``{{baseUrl}}``. You will see its current value is set to ``https://library-api.postmanlabs.com``

6. Now you can **send your request** and see that it works just like before! You should get a status ``200 OK`` response with a list of books.


## Where are my variables?

You can find Collection variables on your collection.

Click on your collection, then the **Variables** tab. Here you can view and edit your variables.

Note that there are two columns:

**Initial Value** - the value initially set when someone forks or imports your collection. Note that if you share your collection with others they will see this value, so don't put any secrets here!

**Current Value** - Postman always resolves the variable to this value. This is local to your Postman account, and not public. It is good to keep secrets like API Keys ONLY in this column and not include in the Initial Value column.


## Update all your requests to use ``{{baseUrl}}``

1. Set all your requests to use ``{{baseUrl}}`` to replace ``https://library-api.postmanlabs.com`` (before the slash ``/``).

2. Be sure to Save each request after the change!

Next you will learn how to set variables automatically, with code!


## Setting variables programmatically

## Scripting in Postman

Postman gives you the ability to add automations and dynamic behaviors to your collections with scripting.

Any Node.js code in the ``Tests`` tab of a request will be executed after a response comes back from the API.

## The ``pm`` object
Postman has a **helper object** named ``pm`` that gives you access data about your postman environment, requests, responses, variables and testing utilities. 

For example, you can access the JSON response body from the API with: 

``pm.response.json()``

You can also programmatically get collection variables like the value of baseUrl with:

``pm.collectionVariables.get(“baseUrl”)``

In addition to getting variables you can also set them with ``pm.collectionVariables.set("variableName", "variableValue")`` like this:

``pm.collectionVariables.set(“myVar”, “foo”)``

## Get ready!

In the next task we will use scripting and the ``pm`` object to automatically set a new book's ``id`` as a collection variable so we can use the ``id`` in other requests.

## Task: Your first script

If you are new to Node.js and JavaScript - have no fear! Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a web browser. 

## Logging data 

In JavaScript, you can print data for a value to the console using this syntax:

```console.log("Hello world!")
  // => Hello world!
```

## Comments

In JavaScript you can add comments to your code. Comments are skipped by the interpreter, so you can use them to explain things in your code if you like. 

```// Single line comments start with two slashes. I am not code!

/* You can write multi-line comments by 
opening and closing with slash and asterisk. 
I am not code!
*/
```

## Add a script to your request

1. In your **add a book** request, change the book data in your **Body** to a new book you like.

2. Open the **Tests** tab of the request

3. Inside the Tests editor, **add this JavaScript** code to log the JSON response from the API:

   ```console.log(pm.response.json())```
   
4. Save your request

5. Send your request. This will trigger the script in the Tests tab to run after the response comes back from the API

6. **Open the Postman Console** in the lower left of the window

7. Scroll to the bottom of the logs in the console. You will see your most recent request ``POST`` ``https://library-api.poistmanlabs.com/books``.

   The response data from the API is logged in the console because of the code in our **Tests** tab! You can **expand the data** by clicking on the small arrow to the left

   ```{id: "361da94d-7abd-47a0-b8ce-a983d31ba2fe", title: "Avengers", author: "Marvel"…}
        id: "361da94d-7abd-47a0-b8ce-a983d31ba2fe"
        title: "Avengers"
        author: "Marvel"
        genre: "Action"
        yearPublished: 2020
        checkedOut: false
        isPermanentCollection: false
        createdAt: "2023-09-19T07:21:58.353Z"
   ```
## Congratulations!

You've written your first script. Next you'll learn how to automatically grab the **id** of your new book and save it as a collection variable.... using code!
